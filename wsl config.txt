Extracting data from web to FTP

1. setting-up WSL and installing vsftpd ("very secured file transfer protocold daemon")
	wsl --install -d Ubuntu 	==> installing Ubuntu
	-- creating username and password --
	sudo su ==> for you not to type your password every single time

	apt install vsftpd 	==> installing vsftpd
	ls /etc/ 	==> to check the vsftpd installed in the directory

2. adjusting vsftpd config
	cp /etc/vsftpd.conf /etc/vsftpd.conf_original	==> creating a copy of vsftpd
	nano /etc/vsftpd.conf	==> edit some setting in the vsftpd
	
	-- Update vsftpd.conf --
	local_enable=YES
	write_enable=YES
	chroot_local_user=YES
	chroot_list_enable=YES
	chroot_list_file=/etc/vsftpd.chrootlist
	ssl_enable=YES
	require_ssl_reuse=NO # add to the bottom of file

	systemctl restart vsftpd  ==> restarting the vsfptd after editing the config
	touch /etc/vsftpd.chroot_list  ==> creating a blank file using touch command for vsftpd.chroot_list

3. Create FTP user
	adduser <ftpuser>  ==> creating your choice user - i use ftpuser
	-- password  ==> password

	mkdir/home/ftpuser/ftp  ==> create a directory inside the the '/home/ftpuser' directory. This is where will be the storage of ftp files	
	chown nobody:nogroup /home/ftpuser/ftp  ==> This command changes the ownership of the newly created ftp directory to the user nobody and the group nogroup. This is often done to ensure that the FTP server process runs with minimal privileges for security reasons.
	chmod a-w /home/ftpuser/ftp  ==> This command revokes write (w) permission for all (a) users on the ftp directory. This means that users other than the owner and group members won't be able to write to this directory.
	sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.chroot_list  ==> This command appends (-a flag) the name of a user (likely the ftpuser) to the file /etc/vsftpd.chroot_list. The vsftpd.chroot_list file is used to specify which users are jailed to their home directories upon FTP login, meaning they can't navigate outside of their home directory. Adding a user to this list ensures that they are restricted to their home directory when accessing the FTP server.
